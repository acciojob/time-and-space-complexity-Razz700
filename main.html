<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a function that describes how long an algorithm takes 
		in terms of the quantity of input it receives. It determines how efficient an algorithm is.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a function that describes how much memory (space) an algorithm requires to 
		the quantity of input to the method. O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to
		the input size.</p>
